# Spain-2019

## Last updated: 16 Mar 2019

This is the repository for the Election StatSheet 2019 Spanish election forecast. Hooray!

In the interest of 100% transparency for the forecast results, I'm putting the scripts and data I use on Github (the ones that are small enough to fit, anyway, which is all of them except for shapefiles). When it's finished, you should be able to enter `"source('Code/simulate.R')"` and obtain exactly the same results as the ones I publish.

*Current status*: Fine-tuning the simulator.
