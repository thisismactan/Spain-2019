# Spain-2019

## Last updated: 19 Mar 2019

This is the repository for the Election StatSheet 2019 Spanish election forecast. Hooray!

In the interest of 100% transparency for the forecast results, I'm putting the scripts and data I use on Github. When it's finished, you should be able to enter `"source('Code/simulate.R')"` and obtain exactly the same results as the ones I publish.

*Current status*: Starting on the RShiny mapp!
